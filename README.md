This is Team 19's solution to the Graph Coursework. Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Here is a [link to our GitLab repository](https://gitlab.cis.strath.ac.uk/ykb20128/graphadt_team19) where you will be able to see all our commits.

## Running the project

Since our application is a web application, you need to run both the server and the client at the same time.

### Backend

Open up a terminal, navigate to the root folder of the project and then run the prebuilt JAR file provided by entering the following command. This will host the API on port 8080.

```
java -jar .\out\artifacts\GraphADT_Team19_jar\GraphADT_Team19.jar
```

Alternatively, if you would like to run the code directly and have `mvn` installed, you could run this.

```
mvn jooby:run
```

### Frontend

After having the server up, you should run the client server. This can be done using the following command **assuming having Node and NPM installed** on the system.

After this, open up [localhost:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173/) in a web browser to see the project running.

Congratulation! You now have everthing set up! Have fun playing our game! ðŸŽ‰

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The project was developed and tested on Node version 16.18.0 and npm version 6.9.0.
